## 🎯 Mission

This project aims to **educate people about the dangers of CBDCs** - programmable money that enables:
- 🔴 **Total financial surveillance** - every transaction tracked
- 🔴 **Account freezing** - political control over your money  
- 🔴 **Programmable restrictions** - expiring money, spending limits
- 🔴 **Cash elimination** - no escape from digital control

We present **Bitcoin as the solution** - a decentralized, censorship-resistant alternative that gives people true financial sovereignty.

## 🚀 Why This Matters

- ✅ Compares CBDC vs Bitcoin side-by-side
- ✅ Provides actionable steps to protect financial freedom

## 🔥 Urgent Call to Action

**The ECB is planning to launch the digital euro by 2028-2030.**

**If we don't act now, our children will grow up in a world where:**
- Every purchase is tracked
- Money can expire
- Accounts can be frozen for any reason
- Cash no longer exists
- Financial privacy is a distant memory

**We have a small window to spread awareness and build alternatives.**

**Fork this repo. Share the website. Talk to people. Act now.**

The clock is ticking. ⏰
